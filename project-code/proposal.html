        <!-- Problem Desc -->
        <!-- Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?"). -->
        <!-- Identify an information technology problem in that space (e.g., "what information problems related to homelessness are unaddressed?"). -->
        <!-- Identify at least 1 previous or existing attempt to solve this problem (e.g., "what other web apps attempt to address homelessness? What has already been tried?") -->
        <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
        <p>Our proposal is for a wellbeing/health tracker application that asks daily questions on the type of physical activity
            one has in their day as well as their mental state for that day, with the goal of building visualizations around that
            data to show a correlation between consistent workouts and higher levels of happiness in day to day life.</p>
        <p>The general topic we chose to tackle is health and wellbeing. We chose this as our topic of interest because it is
            a particular problem for coders and those who sit behinds desks coding all day to not be active or get in enough
            exercise and stretches throughout their day, which we thought was relevant to both our field and a common enough
            problem to try to work through and bring awareness to. We asked ourselves how we could keep track of one’s general
            wellbeing and health and its relation to the emotions one feels in their day and came up with the idea to take account
            of the users' personal belief on how happy they were that day, as well as how much they worked out, and form an association
            with the use of a <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2014/07/08/better-visualizing-of-fitness-app-data-helps-discover-trends-reach-goals/">visualization</a>. </p>

        <!-- Proposed Application -->
        <!-- While social injustices are the problems most worth attacking, your project could also address smaller, or more personal "problems". What is something that makes your life worse, and that you think that a web app might be able to help with? -->
        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>The users of our application will be anybody who cares enough for their wellbeing to start tracking their activity,
            but more specifically our app is targeted towards those with office jobs who may not always be aware of the little
            activity they have. </p>
        <p>There is a lack of information on what incentivizes working out for some people and what does not for others.
            If there is a correlation or visualization made to the user in regard to happiness levels and the amount of
            working out they do in one day, it might further incentivize those who do not to begin incorporating it into their
            daily routines and help build good habits. This will help solve the problem of those with office jobs sitting around
            too much not getting enough physical exercise or stretches in their day to day by giving them the awareness of the
            positive effect their working out has on their mental health and incentivizing it for them.</p>
        <p>The iPhone Health app is a previous attempt at solving this problem that attempts to give iPhone users reminders to
            drink water, take a brief walk, and similar behaviors. It “functions in four main categories: activity, mindfulness,
            sleep and nutrition” and by doing so contains a large amount of data (<cite><a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/the-complete-guide-to-apples-health-app/" target="_blank">Capritto</a><cite></cite>). All this data can be overwhelming and
            cause data overload, making it hard to process and understand everything that is being thrown at the user.</p>

            <!-- Functionality Walkthrough -->
            <!-- feel free to utilize a list to explain what actions a user can perform -->
            <h3>Functional Walkthrough</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily check-in: </strong>First thing app does is make you check in, once entered into the app,
                    the app will ask the user about the number of hours that they were active that day, then will ask user
                    how they would rate their happiness and satisfaction for themselves on that data. (This would be to gather
                    data and build visualizations).</li>
                <li><strong>Visualizations: </strong>Once data is gathered by the app, it will build a visualization providing
                    correlation between amount of fitness and levels of satisfaction/happiness for each day in the form of a
                    chart/graph.</li>
